# dna-sequence-analysis-service
DNA sequence analysis using NCBI BLAST. Upload a DNA sequence, and I will identify the organism or gene and provide a simple report with the closest matches. Includes example input, BLAST results, and report. Ideal for students, researchers, or personal projects.

# 🧬 DNA Sequence Identification Service (BLAST)

This is a simple bioinformatics service that uses BLAST to identify DNA sequences. You provide a FASTA file, and I return a report showing the best matches, species, and gene function.

---

## 🔧 How It Works:
1. You upload a DNA sequence (FASTA format)
2. I run BLAST against the NCBI database
3. I write a short report with results, match %, and interpretation

---

## 🧪 Example:
See `data/example_sequence.fasta`  
BLAST output in `results/blast_results.txt`  
Report in `results/sample_report.pdf`
